    "While there are a number of coffee shops throughout Toronto, it is important to focus precisely on a particular market to be successful. For example a high end, high throughput shop with early opening and closing hours might work well in a central business district, while something that offers more seating and greater meal selection and is open late might appeal to a residential area. Proximity to amenities that are open late, such as movie of dance theaters, may draw enough sophisticated consumers to justify a loss of early morning traffic. For this exercise, I would like to locate an optimal area in which to open a small coffee shop. "
